# Joyful Create

Joyful Create is planned to be an advanced image editing application written in Rust. It aims to provide a robust set of features for professional and amateur artists, comparable to industry-standard tools like Photoshop and GIMP. The name for the project comes from my lovel partner, Myitta, who requested I credit them for this.

## Planned Features

- **Basic Editing**: Crop and transform images.
- **Advanced Effects**: Apply blurring, smudging, and a variety of filters to enhance your images.
- **Layer Management**: Create, manage, and blend layers with multiple options for complex compositions.
- **Drawing Tools**: Utilize splines, various brush tools, and customizable settings for detailed artwork.
- **Color Adjustments**: Fine-tune color balance, brightness, contrast, and other color properties.

## Installation

You will be able to install Joyful Create using Cargo or by downloading pre-built binaries from our GitHub repository.

### Using Cargo

```sh
cargo install joyful_create
```

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be provided as the software evolves. Stay tuned for updates on feature implementations and user guides.
