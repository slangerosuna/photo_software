# Joyful Create

Joyful Create is planned to be an advanced image editing application written in Rust. It is essentially my attempt to make a Rust clone of PhotoShop, Paint.NET, or GIMP, primarily in order to learn. The name for the project comes from my lovely partner, Myitta, who requested I credit them for this.

## Installation

Joyful Create is on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/joyful_create), so it can be installed with Cargo

```sh
cargo install joyful_create
```

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions will be provided as the software evolves. Stay tuned for updates on feature implementations and user guides.
